Mirrored Trees:

If the preorder traversal of one tree is equal to the postorder traversal of another tree
then they are reflections of each other if you were to look at them drawn out.  Functions
included can determine if the two trees have this type of relationship. Also, we can pass
in a binary tree and generate its reflection. An external "main" file is needed to generate
a binary tree and a pointer to its root node is passed to the function. To determine if two
trees are "mirrored", then pass in the two root nodes to the appropriate function.
