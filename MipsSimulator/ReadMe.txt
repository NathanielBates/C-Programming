Mips Simulator:

An input file with MIPS instructions is read into to the spimcore.c simulator.
The project.c file includes the functions for the register manipulation based
on the instructions that are read in along with the setting of control signals
for the generated object code.  The spimcore.c file was provided to me to run
the simulation and is not my material.
